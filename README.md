# Hutch FE Test

Welcome to the coding test for the Hutch Front End Developer position. In this repository, you'll find a very bare bones Angular SPA containing some interfaces from one of our games, some services to load mock data that fulfils the interface contracts, and a page to display this data.

You will find a large chunk of mock data supplied in `adminportal/src/app/mockdata/PortalSync.ts`. This is the sort of size of data we would expect our customer service agents to load for any player in our game. It contains several different pieces of information for a player, based on different parts of the meta game - eg their garage of cars, progress through different tiers, how many ads they have watched, how many purchases they have made etc. 

This data is currently viewable using `adminportal/src/app/user/user.component.html` page (http://localhost:4200/user when running locally). We would like you to rework the loading and display of this data - amaze us with your UI/UX skills! We want to see a clean, fast, user-friendly interface for loading and viewing this data - using appropriate controls and visualizations where possible. The page should work well and be responsive on desktop and mobile. Feel free to split the data up and provide multiple services if you would prefer - however you see fit with these core ideas in mind.
